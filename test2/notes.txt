Three Main Types of Errors
    - Compile time errors are technical errors such as syntax
    - Runtime errors - errors that occur because of the code itself such as infinite recursion loop
    - Logic Errors - the code is not doing what you want it to do but the machine can't tell you what to do

Compile-time Errors
    - Always use incremental development
    - Only the first error message is truly reliable
    - Read errors correctly and make sure there are matching parenthesis and semicolons
    - Don't always listen to what the compiler is telling you to do

Runtime Errors
    - If the program is "hanging", then it is probably in an infinite loop/recursion and you should make changes to the loop (such as a base case)
    - Add print statements to experiment with the execution
    - Try make sure there aren't any null variables
    - Try simplifying print statements

Logic Errors
    - Create a flowchart or something on a sheet of paper
    - Use == to check if objects are identical and .equals to check for equivalence
    - Simplify complex lines of code
    - If you are really stuck, try stepping away from the computer for a few minutes
    - Bring someone else in to look at your code
    - Keep in mind even the best programmers get stuck
    - If you found the bug, take a min to see what caused the bug and how you could have 
    found it faster
